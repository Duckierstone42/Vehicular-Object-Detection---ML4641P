## Introduction/Background
  We will use unsupervised learning algorithms to create a pairs trading strategy. We will use clustering/unsupervised learning to find related stocks. We will incorporate a long-short strategy. We will use supervised learning with the stock pairs as labels. When a pair of stocks deviates from its cluster, we will go long, the falling one stock and short the rising stock. We will use Profit-Loss to determine the success of our process.
Related literature includes: Pairs Trading Via Unsupervised Learning by Han, He, and Toh (2021) which creates an unsupervised learning pairs trading strategy using firm characteristics; Optimized Pair Trading Strategy using Unsupervised Machine Learning by Gupta, Kumar, Yuvraj (2023) which uses clustering algorithms to pair stocks and optimizes them using the Engle-Granger test; Pairs Trading Using Clustering and Deep Reinforcement Learning by Roychoudhury, Bhagtani, and Daftari (2023) which uses clustering and reinforcement learning to avoid the conventional linear assumption of paired stocks.
We will be using OHLC charts from Yahoo Finance. For example: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history/] contains a button for downloading historical daily data. We will choose a basket of stocks based on industry and assumed completion, and then download their data.


## Problem Definition
  It is important to have a trading strategy to be an investor and not a speculator. Predicting and understanding stock price movement is notoriously difficult though. Thus we need to utilize machine learning to find patterns in the data that is hidden from plain observation.
